=== KanaRecog

This is a simple application for practicing Hiragana and Katakana. The site is live at http://kanarecog.heroku.com

If you are interested in the word-list I use it resides in the db/ directory along with the script I use to transfer it to the database.

If there are any other questions feel free to ask.
